## Setting up your motors

There are two common ways to connect a **motor controller** to your Rapsberry Pi 4 depending on the controller you have.
+ Plugging it straight onto the GPIO pins
+ connecting it using jumper cables or wires

A common and very inexpensive motor controller is the L298N Dual H Bridge DC Stepper Motor Driver Controller Board which you would connect using jumper cables and wires. If you have this kind of controller, there are simple instructions on how to connect it in the [Python build a robot buggy project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-a-buggy/2){:target="_blank"}.

The instructions here are for a [CamJam EduKit 3 motor controller](https://thepihut.com/products/camjam-edukit-motor-controller){:target="_blank"} which simply fits straight on top of the Pi's GPIO pins.
