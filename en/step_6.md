## Reaction game

There are so many things that you can make using a motor before we move on to robot buggies. How about making some moving art, a motorised scene from history, a winch, or maybe something that nobody ever thought of before.

Try making this simple reaction game and then maybe have a go at making something of your own.

The idea is to have a target, maybe an object to take, that the player needs to get to, and the motor drives a pen or stick that the player needs to avoid.

Stick a pen to one of your wheels. Using masking tape or Blu Tack work fine for this.

If you prefer, you could use a stick or straw to avoid getting your fingers covered in pen ink!

Attach the wheel to your motor and fix it down to your playing surface. You could use a table, a board or even a piece of stiff cardboard so you can move it around.

In the example, the motor is stuck on blobs of Blu Tack and then masking tape stops it from falling over all the time.

Angle the motor as you like to protect your chosen target spot.
