## Reaction game

There are so many things that you can make using a motor before we move on to robot buggys. How about making some moving art, a motorised scene from history, a winch, or maybe something that nobody ever thought of before.

Try making this simple reaction game and then maybe have a go at making something of your own.

The idea is to have a target, maybe an object to take, that the player needs to get to, and the motor drives a pen or stick that the player needs to avoid.
