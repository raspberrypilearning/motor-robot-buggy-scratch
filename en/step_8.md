## Remote Scratch and Real VNC

In all of the projects covered so far, would be easier if the Rapsberry Pi was not attached to a monitor, Ethernet cable, keyboard, and mouse. 

It is fairly easily to remove your Raspberry Pi from these components, as long as it is connected to the WiFi. You also need to have another computer connected to the same network to access your Raspberry Pi _remotely_, through Real VNC which is pre-installed on your Pi. You can use any type of computer to access your Pi remotely; this includes another Raspberry Pi which usually has the software needed already installed.

As you move on to coding your buggy, it becomes much easier to work with if you have remote access and this allows your robot buggy to roam freely without wires attached.

If you have not already used Real VNC to remote onto your Raspberry Pi, you can follow these instructions.
