## Remote Scratch using Real VNC

All of the projects that we have looked at so far would be easier if your Rapsberry Pi was not attached to a monitor, ethernet cable, keyboard and mouse. 

We can do that fairly easily, as long as your Raspberry Pi is connected to the WiFi and you have another computer connected to the same network, but accessing your Raspberry Pi _remotely_ using Real VNC which comes pre-installed on your Pi. You can use any type of computer to access your Pi remotely including another Raspberry Pi which usually has the software needed already installed.

As you move on to coding your buggy, it becomes much easier to work with if you have remote access allowing your robot buggy to roam freely without wires attached.

If you have not already used Real VNC to remote onto your Raspberry Pi, you can follow these instructions.
