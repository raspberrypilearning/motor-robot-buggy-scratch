## Making a robot buggy

Robot buggies are a really popular making and coding project and once you have a robot that can drive around there are all sorts of ways to adapt it and grow you project, like adding lights and even sensors.

Let's start by looking at the robot's chassis - the basic body of your robot buggy.

The first thing you will need to do is look at the materials that you have, think about the materials you want and can get hold of and about the design of your robot buggy.

Your robot buggy will need to have:

+ A base to fix the motors and roller wheel to, and to support your electronics
+ A gear motor on each side - usually at the back but they could go near the front
+ A roller ball - placed to make your robot buggy stable

Your robot buggy will need to hold:

+ A Raspberry Pi 4
+ A 4xAA battery box
+ A power supply for the Raspberry Pi, e.g. a USB powerbank

Make a quick design sketch of what your buggy will look like and importantly, where all your components will fit.

The sketch above showed that the size of the chassis (the buggy's main body) would be dictated by the combined width of the two gear motors and the battery box. I laid them out on a piece of cardboard to see how wide the chassis would need to be.

There is no problem with adapting your design as you go along and you find problems, possibilities or your ideas change. The design sketch above resulted in this robot buggy. Small, compact and functional but yours can be whatever you want it to be!

You do not need the perfect box for a robot buggy. Chances are there will be a great box, pieces of cardboard or other packaging around your home, school or wherever you are that would make a fantastic robot buggy.

It does not have to be any certain size or shape. You can experiment, evaluate and reinvent your robot as you like.

You might want to use a piece of packaging just as it comes, make adjustments to an exisiting packet make your own chassis from scratch.

Hot melt glue guns are not necessary but are an ideal tool for putting your robot buggy together.

Having your motors secured both below and above, like a _motor sandwich_, makes them very stable. Your robot will drive much better if the motors are firmly in place rather than flopping around.
