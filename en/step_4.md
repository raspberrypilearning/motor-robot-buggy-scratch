## What are motors for?

You have two motors and two wheels. You can control them in Scratch and now you know what each GPIO pin does.

What next? What can you do with two motors?

The obvious answer is to build a motorised buggy but with a little imagination, there's much more you could do.

What do you want your motor to do?

### Anything that spins?

Since the gear motor turns, you could make something that spins. It could be ferris wheel, a helicopter, a merry-go-round, or how about a windmill?

Decide what you want to make, collect some materials and make it!

If you can't decide what to make, how about making a windmill, just like this example.

Think about where the motor will need to go for your project to work.
