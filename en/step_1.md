## Introduction

In this project you will learn how to wire and control button motors as electronic outputs using a simple motor controller and a Raspberry Pi 4 running the latest version of Scratch. 
You will make a robot buggy and write different Scratch programs to control your robot buggy in different ways.

This projects follows on from the **LEDs, buzzers and scratch games** outputs and **Button switches, Scratch 3 and Raspberry Pi 4** inputs physical computing project both using Scratch 3 and a Raspberry Pi 4.
