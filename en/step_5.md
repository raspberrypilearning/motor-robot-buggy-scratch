## Challenge: Adapting your motor project

This is a very open challenge with enormous room for freedom in what you do. 

Take your project from the lest section, or another if you like, and turn it into something else, adapt it, improve it in some way you had not originally thought of!

The changes could involve more making, more coding or both! There is no right or wrong. You are the judge of whether the change is an improvement or not.

If you feel a bit overwhelmed by open possibilities, how about turning your creation into a _crazy golf_ obstacle where you have to try and get a ball past your moving obstacle?
