## Challenge: Adapting your motor project

This is a very open challenge with enormous room for freedom in what you do. 

Take your project from the lest section, or another if you like, and turn it into something else, adapt it, improve it in some way you had not originally thought of!

The changes could involve more making, more coding or both! There is no right or wrong. You are the judge of whether the change is an improvement or not.

If you feel a bit overwhelmed by open possibilities, how about turning your creation into a _crazy golf_ obstacle where you have to try and get a ball past your moving obstacle?

The crazy golf idea doesn't need to end there. You could have a moving obstacle to try and get a remote control buggy past, or something else, like a Sphero. Use whatever you can get your hands on!

What you will need to do for a crazy golf project:
+ have a target or destination for the ball (or robot) to get to
+ code your obstacle to move in a way that makes getting past possible, but not too easy

For the example windmill, a hole has been cut in the front of the mill and the **target** is getting a ball **inside** the windmill itself!

You'll probably come across unexpected issues as you go. The Raspberry Pi and battery box used to sit at the bottom of the windmill, so they needed to find a new home.
